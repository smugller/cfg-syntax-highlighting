# Installation

Just install extension from Visual Studio Marketplace and enjoy! It's working only with `.cfg` file extensions!

## Test if everything is working

With this extensions I will add the `examples` folder, so you can test this plugin on your computer. Just open file `autoexec.cfg` from directory **$HOME/.vscode/extensions/cs-go-syntax-highlighter-pro/examples/autoexec.cfg** and `Select Language Mode` in VSCode or `Configure File Association for '.cfg' ...` files.

# Customize your config

## How to get all latest cvars from source engine?

Maybe you didn't know, but it's almost 5000 commands and cvars in CS:GO. This is really huge list that should be sorted with a modern way!

Here yo have plugin to reveal all console variables/commands that are marked as hidden/development-only. It's nice to check time to time for deprecated or new cvar commands.

Ready to view all cvar commands directly from GitHub (check the date and time, because I'm not guaranteed that these repo will be always updated). You can easily look for all CS:GO cvars alongside ones marked as hidden/development-only. Repo is contributed by ArminC.
